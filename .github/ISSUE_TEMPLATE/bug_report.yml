        What did you do for the bug to show up?

        If you can't cause the bug to show up again reliably (and hence don't have a proper set of steps to give us), please still try to give as many details as possible on how you think you encountered the bug.

        ‚ö†Ô∏è Please **DO NOT** add links to SimpleMobileTools issues as they can be deleted at any time. Instead, copy-paste any useful information or instructions manually.
